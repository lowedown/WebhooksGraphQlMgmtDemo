# Webhooks and GraphQL Autoring & Management API Demo

This is the code that goes together with my presentation on Webhooks and the GraphQL Authoring & Management API. You can use this as inspiration but this code is *not production ready*.

## Projects

### Sitecore.XM.AuthWebApp

Simple MVC Application that you can use for generating a GraphQL API Token using your identity server. This is needed if you're on Sitecore XM/XP 10.3+. Se the separate readme for setup instructions.

### SitecoreXM.Logic

Some controllers which receive webhooks input and do some cool things using the Authoring & Management API
